     <p>For something to be considered hyoallergenic, it must be <span style="color: violet;font-weight: bold">relatively unlikely</span> to trigger an allergic reaction in someone. Animals that are considere "hypoallergenic" generally have longer hair that doesn't shed. This allows dander (dead skin particales) to stay embedded within the hair instead of being released into the air.</p>

   <div style= "background-color: teal;color: seashell; padding: 20px;">
     <p>It's impoprtant to note that even if a dog is completely hairless, it's still going to produce dander (i.e. allergens). So in technical terms, no- Goldendoodles are not hypoallergenic, as <span style="color: turquoise;font-weight: bold">no dogs are</span>. Though in rare instances, some dogs are merely "considered" hypoallergenic- such as Poodles.</p>
